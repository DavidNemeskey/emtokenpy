# README

Python wrapper for the [quntoken](https://github.com/dlt-rilmta/quntoken)
tokenizer.

## Requirements

* OS: linux x86-64

## Usage

Please refer to [e-magyar-tsv](https://github.com/dlt-rilmta/e-magyar-tsv) for
usage.

## Caveat

The `emtokenpy.py` is a demo suffering from performance issues, do not use it.
The preferred way to use quntoken with e-magyar-tsv is run it with `emw.sh`
(see in the [repo](https://github.com/dlt-rilmta/e-magyar-tsv) of
e-magyar-tsv).
